Javascript (JS) is essentially used to modify and change different aspects of a website. This includes various html elements and css styles. It can allow a web app to be more interactable and dynamic in terms of it's displayed content.

It can be defined within an html document or in an external file. The <script></script> tags define a section of javascript code in an html document.

It is recommended to use external javascript files. They can be referenced in the html document by including the filepath in the src attribute of the script tags.

Most of the functionality of javascript is similar to other programming and scripting languages (variables, conditionals, functions, while/for loops, etc...)

However, a distinct feature of javascript is the console.log function which allows you to print information in the browser console.
