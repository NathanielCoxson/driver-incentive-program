React is a library for javascript that provides frameworks for creating dynamic webpages and interfaces.

To create an app you can use a package manager and NodeJS to setup and create react applications. 

Create a react app:
- npx create-react-app <name of app>

Run the app:
- navigate to the react app directory
- npm start

The app should run on localhost:3000

React is incredibly useful in creating single page applications as it can modify several display elements easily.
