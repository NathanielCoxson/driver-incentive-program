Relational Databases

The key advantage of relational databases is being able to relate tables using shared keys.

Table1 may have an id key for a user while Table2 may have an id key with the same values, so you can
relate the records of Table1 with Table2 on their similar keys.

Tables:

    Tables should only have one primary key that makes records uniquely identifiable.

    Attributes should contain only one value and the data type should be the same for the entire column.

    Foreign keys can be defined so that tables can reference one another.

Relationships:

    Entity relationsihps can be 1-1, 1-many, or many-many.

    Many-many relationships need to be avoided in the database because they can lead to anomalies and should
    instead be represented using two 1-many relationships by adding a third relational table the each instance
    where the two entities are related.


Normalization:

    It is important to ensure that the database design conforms to a specific level of normalization to prevent
    data anomalies like insert, delete, and update anomalies.

    An example of a data anomaly would if you update one record but there are other records that need to be changed.
    You may only update the one record which would leave the other ones incorrect. This is avoided by normalizing the table.

    There are several forms of normalization: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF. Without going into detail the main idea
    is that there shouldn't be duplicated records in the table. If things are being duplicated then there is redundancy and you 
    probably need to create another table.
