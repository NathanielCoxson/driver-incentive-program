    Main Skills:
        HTML - structures pages
        CSS - styles the HTML pages
        JavaScript - used to make pages functional

    Basic web development involves writing HTML files to fill the page with 
    content and then linking CSS files where you write styles for the elements
    in your HTML. 

    The HTML elements that you create are placed in the DOM (document object model) which
    is the way that the browser organizes and interprets the page content so that it can
    be displayed to the user. JavaScript can be used to interact with the DOM so that you
    can manipulate HTML elements in real time as the user interacts with the page. One way 
    that you can utilize JS is by handling events that occur in the browser. JS allows you 
    to interact with the browser through a variety of events to add functionality to the page.
