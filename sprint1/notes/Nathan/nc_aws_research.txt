    EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud:
        Virtual cloud server modules offered by AWS.

    AWS charges you only for the resources you are currently using.
    You can easily scale your resources on AWS at any time, but you can easily
    scale back if you no longer need certain resources.

How to Use:
    First you need to have a account to login with.

    The dashboard gives an overview of services you have actively running
    as well as the costs associated with them.

    You need to select the services you want and go through the setup process to start 
    using it.

    Make sure that you are using us-east-1 as the server location.

EC2 and RDS:
    You can search for services in the top right.

    EC2s are servers that you can set up and run. For our purposes, they can be used
    to host our web app in the cloud and be publicly accessible through their IP.

    RDS are database servers that you can use to host the database.

    You need to have a VPC (virtual private cloud) set up for each of these.

    In order to connect to either the EC2 or the database server, you have to set the
    inbound/outbound rules apporiately. In order to access the public IP of an EC2 you need
    to enable HTTP/HTTPS inbound protocols from all sources.

    The public IP of an EC2 can change, so you need to enable an elastic ip on the left-hand side
    under "Elastic IPs".

    The RDS can be any of several database systems, for our project we are using SQL Server.

    With EC2 running the web server, we can connect to the RDS to run queries on the database for
    the web app to function.

    EC2 has several OS options, Linux or Ubuntu would be preferable, and for hardware the free tier is good.
