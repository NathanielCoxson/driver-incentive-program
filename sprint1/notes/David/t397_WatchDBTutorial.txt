Table Design
We have distinct tables, where each row represents a specific type of entity, and the columns represent an attribute of a given entity
Important to have a primary key, which is an attribute that is unique to every row in a table
Connecting Tables
Establish relationships between tables on similar elements between the two
Can be done by creating a foreign key in a table, or by setting up an associative table that lists how the attributes of two different tables are related, and then making a relationship between each table and the associative table
Relationship Types
Can have 1:1, 1:M, or M:N relationships, which specifies how many records from one table is related to how many records from the other table
