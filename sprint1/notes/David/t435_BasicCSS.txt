What is CSS?
A styling language used for changing the presentation of HTML elements
CSS Syntax
selector { property1: value; property2: value;}
Selector: defines the element we are modifying
Properties are key-value pairs, specified by the element type
CSS Selectors
Elements: Defines all elements as that specified
Class: Allows you to define subtypes of elements, defined by attribute class=”classname”
An element can have multiple classes
Selected by elementName.className
ID: Similar to class, but is specific to an element instance, defined by id=”id-name”
An element can have only one ID
Selected by #id-name
Can combine multiple selectors at once
Example: #id.class1.class2 selects an element with the ID name “id”, and with both the class1 and class2 classes
Can specify ancestors (nested elements) using the notation: ancestor child (separated by a space), which selects all child elements that are nested within an ancestor element
Can give the same properties to separate elements by splitting them with commas
Loading CSS Styles
Can be done inline using style=CSS (bad), can be done in a style element using <style> (only applies within file, cannot be reused elsewhere), or can be done in an external CSS using <line rel=”stylesheet” href=”filename” /> (the best option)
