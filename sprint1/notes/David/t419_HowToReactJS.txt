Getting Started
React is a frontend framework for writing code directly in HTML
Node.js gives you the environment to create your own webpage in localhost:3000
Can run the page directly from your directory, which will launch in your browser
ES6 Classes
Can define a class using class {}
Inside a class body, you can define functions, including a constructor() which is called on initialization
ES6 Destructuring
Instead of individually assigning elements from an array, can assign using [var1, var2, var3] = listname, which will assign the corresponding elements from listname
If you want to skip elements, simply skip the variable so that there’s nothing between the commas
ES6 Spread Operator
Can use …listname to quickly copy out all elements from a list
Can be used in conjunction with destructuring
Render HTML
createRoot(element) takes an HTML element where the React component will be displayed
Commonly use getElementID(elementName) to get a reference to the ID, but elementName should be listed in index.html
render(toRender) displays the component in the element specified by createRoot()
