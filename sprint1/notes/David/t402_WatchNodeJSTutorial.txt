What is Node.js?
A runtime that lets you run JS on a server instead of the browser, which can be faster
How Node.js Works
Visit a web address that points to your server, which sends a request to your server
Your server sends back a response in form of an HTML page, which is displayed in your browser
JS Features
Console.log(message) lets you print to the console log
global lets you assign global variables
Example: global.pi = 3.1415
Events
process.on(‘eventname’, function(){}) executes the specified inline function whenever the given event occurs from the process
Can specify specific event triggers using the EventEmitter() class, where you can specify event triggers on custom events using emit(message)
File System
Functions with Sync use blocking to ensure completion of the task
Used by file reads
Keyword async can be used to specify functions that have blocking in them
Keyword await can ensure that blocking takes place, and that code execution is halted until the blocking function is done
Modules
Can import modules using “const moduleName = require(‘module_filepath’)”
Can export as a module from a .js file using “module.exports = { export1: value}”, where export1 is a key-value pair
See details about express in video and in documentation
