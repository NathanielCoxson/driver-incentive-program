Intro to NodeJS
An open source JS environment
Works well handling concurrent connections and I/O operations without blocking
Coding in NodeJS
createServer() method creates a new HTTP server and returns it
Can pass a function as an argument, allowing you to run JS code to generate HTML elements, thus creating a webpage
The returned HTTP server object can call listen(), which lets you listen on a specified port and hostname and run code via a function in response
When the server request is received, a request object (has request details) and a response object (used to return data to the caller) are returned, and can be used
