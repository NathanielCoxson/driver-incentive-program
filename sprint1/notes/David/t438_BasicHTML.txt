Getting Started with HTML
index.html often represents the homepage of websites, so it’s a good starting point
<!DOCTYPE html>: A common preamble to HTML files, which lets browsers know that it’s an HTML file
<html>: Tag for defining the entire HTML page
CSS Basics
<style>: Used for defining style rules in CSS
Can reference other page elements within the tab body
Example: img { width: 100px; border-radius: 10px; } gives all image elements a width of 100 pixels and a border radius of 10 pixels
Can use class attribute to give an element a type of identifier to have different subtypes of elements
Example: <p class=”main”> lets you reference p.main, which specifies a certain subtype of paragraph elements
